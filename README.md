# self-notes

Welcome to my self-notes repository.
Here, you'll find a collection of random notes, all written in Markdown. While these notes may vary in usefulness to others, they are kind of valuable to me as a way to organize my thoughts and ideas.

You can explore and glean any insights that resonate with you from these self-notes. Happy reading!

## Notes index:

1. on-productivity - Productivity hacks and techniques compiled.
2. list_of_tools - List of some components or parts or tools I might get familiar with for my projects.
3. supplements-and-routine - Supplement routine for improved overall health.
