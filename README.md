# self-notes

Welcome to my self-notes repository.
Here, you'll find a collection of random notes, all written in Markdown. While these notes may vary in usefulness to others, they are kind of valuable to me as a way to organize my thoughts and ideas.

You can explore and glean any insights that resonate with you from these self-notes. Happy reading!
